# Minions

This repository provides specialized instructions and rulesets designed to enhance the performance of AI agents like Cursor, Windsurf, and potentially others when performing software development tasks.

The goal is to guide these agents to work more systematically, predictably, and effectively than they might using only their base programming. This is achieved by providing detailed "persona" files or rule sets that define specific roles, workflows, and interaction patterns.

## Current Instructions

Currently, the repository contains instructions for the following roles:

*   **Developer**: Defined in `developer/.cursorrules`. This file outlines a strict, step-by-step process for analyzing requirements, planning implementation, interacting with stakeholders (users), and executing coding tasks. It emphasizes clarity, risk assessment, and sequential execution.

Feel free to explore the existing instruction files to understand the approach. More roles and refinements may be added over time.
