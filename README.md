# 🤖 AI Minions

Welcome! 👋 This repository provides specialized instructions and rulesets designed to supercharge 🚀 AI agents like Cursor, Windsurf, and potentially others when performing software development tasks.

The goal is to guide these agents to work more systematically, predictably, and effectively than they might using only their base programming. We achieve this by providing detailed "persona" files or rule sets that define specific roles, workflows, and interaction patterns. Think of them as playbooks for your AI assistants! 🧠

## Current Instructions 📜

Currently, the repository contains instructions for the following roles:

*   **Developer** 🧑‍💻: Defined in [developer.md](./developer.md). This file outlines a strict, step-by-step process for analyzing requirements, planning implementation, interacting with stakeholders (users), and executing coding tasks. It emphasizes clarity ✨, risk assessment 🧐, and sequential execution ✅.
*   **Tester** 🧪: Defined in [tester.md](./tester.md). This file describes the process for a Quality Assurance Engineer, focusing on systematic verification, plan creation, and rigorous testing methodologies.

Feel free to explore the existing instruction files to understand the approach. More roles and refinements may be added over time. Stay tuned! 👀 

## 🤝 Interacting with the AI Agents: A Collaborative Approach

Working with AI agents powered by these instructions (like the Developer and Tester) is a departure from the typical "fire-and-forget" interaction you might have with some AI tools. Instead, it's a **highly interactive and collaborative dialogue** 💬, designed to ensure the AI fully understands your needs and that you have full transparency into its process.

Here's the essence of the interaction:

1.  **Your Request, Their Plan:** You provide a requirement 📝. The AI agent doesn't just jump into action. First, it creates a dedicated plan file (e.g., in `.minions/developer_plans/your_plan_title.md`). This file becomes your central hub 🏡 for the entire task.
2.  **Deep Dive & Intelligent Questions:** The agent meticulously analyzes your request 🕵️‍♂️, examines the existing codebase, and identifies potential ambiguities, risks, or areas needing more clarity. It then populates the plan file with specific, contextual questions 🤔. This isn't a sign of incompetence; it's an **intelligent feedback mechanism** at work! The agent is proactively seeking to avoid misunderstandings and ensure it's on the right track *before* committing to significant work.
3.  **Your Insights are Key:** You, as the stakeholder, review these questions directly in the plan file and provide your answers and clarifications 🗣️. This iterative Q&A is crucial. The agent will not proceed until all its critical questions are answered to its satisfaction, ensuring a shared understanding.
4.  **Transparent Action Planning:** Once clarity is achieved, the agent proposes a detailed, step-by-step action plan 🗺️ within the same plan file. This outlines exactly what it intends to do (e.g., which files to change, what tests to write).
5.  **Your Green Light:** You review this action plan. The AI agent **waits for your explicit approval** 👍 before executing any of the proposed tasks. You are in control.
6.  **Execution & Reporting:** Upon approval, the agent works through the tasks sequentially ⚙️, updating the plan file with its progress (marking tasks as "✅ DONE").
7.  **Final Review & Handoff:** Once all tasks are complete, the agent provides a summary of its work 📄, including implementation details or testing notes, directly in the plan file.

This structured interaction might seem more involved, but it offers significant advantages:

*   **Reduced Misunderstandings:** The proactive questioning minimizes guesswork ✔️.
*   **Increased Transparency:** You always know what the AI is thinking, planning, and doing 🔎.
*   **Greater Control:** Key decisions and go-aheads remain with you 🕹️.
*   **Higher Quality Outcomes:** By addressing potential issues early and ensuring alignment, the final result is more likely to meet your precise requirements 🎯.

Think of it as having a very diligent, systematic, and communicative AI partner who prefers to measure twice and cut once 📏✂️, ensuring every action is thoughtful and contributes effectively to your goals. This approach leverages the AI's analytical power while keeping you firmly in the driver's seat 🚗.
