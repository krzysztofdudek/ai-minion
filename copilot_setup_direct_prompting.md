# Using `prompt.md` with GitHub Copilot: Direct Prompting (Simplest Method)

This document outlines the simplest way to use the full `prompt.md` AI worker persona with GitHub Copilot by directly pasting its content into the chat.

## Method: Direct Pasting of `prompt.md`

This approach is straightforward and ensures Copilot receives the complete set of instructions for a specific, complex task when you need it to adopt the full "AI Worker" persona.

1.  **Open `prompt.md`:**
    *   Locate and open the `prompt.md` file from this repository.

2.  **Copy Content:**
    *   Select and copy the **entire content** of the `prompt.md` file.

3.  **Paste into Copilot Chat:**
    *   Open a new chat session with GitHub Copilot.
    *   Paste the copied content directly into the chat input.
    *   Immediately follow the pasted prompt with your specific task request.

**Example Interaction:**

> **User:** (Pastes entire content of `prompt.md`)
>
> **User:** Now, acting as the AI Worker defined above, I need you to analyze the `PaymentGateway` interface and propose a plan to integrate a new payment provider.

## When to Use This Method

*   **Simplicity:** This is the most direct way to provide the full persona to Copilot without any prior setup of instruction files.
*   **Specific Complex Tasks:** Ideal when you have a substantial task that would benefit from the detailed workflow and principles outlined in `prompt.md`.
*   **Full Control:** Ensures that for the current interaction, Copilot is operating under the complete set of instructions from `prompt.md`.

While GitHub Copilot also supports a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file for repository-level guidance (see `copilot_setup_instructions_file.md`), that file is meant for more concise instructions. For leveraging the full, detailed `prompt.md`, direct pasting is the recommended approach for targeted application.
